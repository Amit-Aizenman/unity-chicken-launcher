Chicken Launcher
============

In this project, I developed a 2D interactive chicken-launching scene that incorporates a variety of gameplay elements. The scene features chickens being launched into the air (utilizing an object pool), with spatial and non-spatial sound effects playing alongside music. The UI is highly responsive, allowing users to control and interact with the scene seamlessly.
This project was part of my Game Development minor, a program jointly offered by Bezalel Academy of Art and Design and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

## Key Learnings
- Designed and implemented a UI Canvas, added UI elements with RectTransform, and anchored them to relative positions for responsiveness.
- Integrated UI components such as Image, Button, and TextMeshPro for dynamic visual elements.
- Utilized object pooling to optimize performance by reusing objects in the scene.
